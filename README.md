# Survival_Game
First coding assignment ever in Python. Never forget. 

# Adventure Survival Game 
For a person who has never coded before and had Python as her first coding class ever, this was a bit challenging. We had this assignment due a week after our class started. Now that I see it, is something so simple, but back then it took me hours to do. It is still not perfect, but in the data scientist world you can only become better with practice. 
We had to create this game applying everything we had learn in the first week of class. Inputing variables, nested condition statements, loops, and some functions. It was a hard but fun assignment. Hope you like it!
